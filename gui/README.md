# GUI

## Potential GUI Components
0. See image for use other use cases
1. Pause, Play, Step controls for runtime
2. Legal Guidelines (in the information-bar)
3. (optional) Color theme choices for the map
4. Phase 0 (a button should exist to running)
    - Bloc population percentage threshold
    - Block voting percentage threshold
5. Minorities for minority-majority
6. Parties to select
7. Desired number of minority populations to consider, and the maximum and minimum population percentages for each ethnic group. The user will also be able to specify that multiple minority groups can be combined.
8. (required) Display population distribution table. (see use case 42)
9. Display the calculated majority minority districts in a table. Table should also show a comparison with the majority-minority results for the current districting
10. Have a nob or button to indicate whether the algorithm should run with incremental updates or in one fell swoop (31)
11. Sliders for Measure Weights, threshold for majority minority (38)
12. I would use a toggle button to switch from the new to the old, but I am not quite sure what is the best way to do this (39)
13. Display all of these scores by using a mouse over functionality that when we mouse over any specific district will show all relevant stats in a side box (40)
14. User input controls for bloc population % threshold and bloc voting percentage threshold (presumably sliders and respective labels)
15. “phase 0” button (name comes from use case document) which prompts the system to analyze the population of each precinct.
16. A table to display voting demographic bloc analysis
17. State map updates with demographic analysis data
